# Automatic-Room-Lighting-using-8051-microcontroller
C program for automatic room lighting system based on 8051 micro-controller

Introduction
Electricity, being one of the most important resources, must be utilized carefully. We often forget to switch off lights or fans when we leave a room. By using this system, we can intentionally forget about the lights as the system will automatically take care of them.

Project Description
The project aims to automatically turn on or off the lights in a room by detecting the human movement. Since the job of the circuit is to turn on the light when someone enters the room and turn off the light when the last person leaves the room, the project has to internally count the number of visitors entering and leaving the room. Hence, the project acts as an Automatic Room Lighting System as well as Bidirectional Visitor Counter.

Specifications
The project has the following specifications:
•	One microcontroller
•	Atmel’s AT89C51 microcontroller
•	Program in C language
•	8051 Development Board
•	Infrared Sensors
•	PIR sensor
•	16x2 LCD
